/*
Basic architecture
The 6502 use little endian for byte order

The first 256 bytes (FF) page of memory is referred to as 'Zero Page' and is the focus of a number of special addressing modes that result in shorter (and quicker)
instructions or allow indirect access to memory. 

Second page ($0100 to $01FF) is reserved for the stack and cannot be relocated.

The only other reserved locations in the memory map are the very last 6 bytes of memory $FFFA to $FFFF which must be programmed 
with the addresses of the non-maskable interrupt handler ($FFFA/B), 
the power on reset location ($FFFC/D) and the BRK/interrupt request handler ($FFFE/F) respectively.
